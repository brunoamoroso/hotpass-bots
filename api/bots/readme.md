# Setting up a Bot

## Inside the project
First you need to create a file for the bot. It's highly recommended to use the name of the person that will be the owner.

Then you should set its path for webhooks, its database name that'll be used along the service.

## Set the telegram webhook
After pushing the last changes to the remote branch its time to set the webhook on the telegram server
